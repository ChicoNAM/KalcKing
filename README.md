KalcKing is a dynamic web-based calculator application designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The program features 5 progressive levels, each introducing a new mathematical operator to gradually increase the challenge and deepen your understanding of mathematical concepts.

Level 1: Basic addition (+)
Level 2: Subtraction (-)
Level 3: Multiplication (*)
Level 4: Division (/)
Level 5: Exponentiation (^)

Key Features:

Interactive Levels: Solve problems using various arithmetic operations as you progress through the game.
Save and Load Functionality: Save your progress and continue where you left off, enabling flexibility in gameplay.
Custom Images: The visual design, including custom images, was created using ChatGPT and DALL-E, giving the game a unique aesthetic that complements its educational purpose.

KalcKing was built as a practical way to explore and understand key JavaScript concepts such as switch cases and DOM manipulation. Throughout the development process, the project provided hands-on experience with creating and invoking functions, 
managing different operational logic with switch statements, and dynamically updating the DOM based on user interactions. This helped to advance knowledge in structuring complex JavaScript code and building interactive web applications.
