### Additional Information

_KalcKing_ was built as a practical way to explore and understand key JavaScript concepts such as switch cases and DOM manipulation. 
Throughout the development process, the project provided hands-on experience with creating and invoking functions, 
managing different operational logic with switch statements, and dynamically updating the DOM based on user interactions. 
This helped to advance knowledge in structuring complex JavaScript code and building interactive web applications.
